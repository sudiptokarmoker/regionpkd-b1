Alright, seems it is working fine on your side.
For the test code audition basically you have to build an Admin panel viewing / editing user accounts (table). You can use 3rd party libraries for the development. 
Available filters: email, verified (0/1), NIP, name, premium (0/1 )

Displayed columns: email, verified (0/1), NIP, name, address, premium access till specifc date once the payment has been done, 
last login (date)
+ a column at the end with the "edit" button, which takes you to the form where you can change all the values for the user and set a new password

While checking the company - if the current user is "premium", then once the entity has been found in the database, we display a list of ratings and comments about it.

At all we need to be sure about your well coding practice in architecting project.. conventions, structure, how make the foundation of the app and organize files and folders through most important coding guidelines and quality. This knowledge is indispensable to undertake work in our team room.
